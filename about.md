        <h2 class="text-white text-[22px] font-bold leading-tight tracking-[-0.015em] px-4 pb-3 pt-5">Our Story</h2>
        <p class="text-white text-base font-normal leading-normal pb-3 pt-1 px-4">
            Two friends with a shared love for authentic Italian cuisine discovered the art of Neapolitan pizza making. After countless hours perfecting our dough recipe and mastering our Ooni ovens, we decided to share our passion with others. From our first backyard gathering to catering events for 150+ guests, we've maintained our commitment to authentic ingredients and traditional techniques.

        <h2 class="text-white text-[22px] font-bold leading-tight tracking-[-0.015em] px-4 pb-3 pt-5">Our Philosophy</h2>
        <p class="text-white text-base font-normal leading-normal pb-3 pt-1 px-4">
            We believe in simplicity and quality. True Neapolitan pizza requires just four ingredients: Italian 00 flour, water, salt, and fresh yeast. No shortcuts, no artificial additives - just authentic ingredients that have been perfected over centuries in Naples, Italy.
        </p>

        <p class="text-white text-base font-normal leading-normal pb-3 pt-1 px-4">
            Unlike traditional catering services or food trucks, we bring a complete mobile pizza experience to your location. Our setup requires only a 10x10 space and can work both indoors and outdoors. We prepare our dough 24 hours in advance for the perfect texture, and each pizza cooks in just 90 seconds at 850°F in our professional Ooni ovens.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-white text-[22px] font-bold leading-tight tracking-[-0.015em] px-4 pb-3 pt-5">Our Commitment</h2>
        <p class="text-white text-base font-normal leading-normal pb-3 pt-1 px-4">
            Every ingredient we use is imported directly from Italy to ensure authentic taste. From our San Marzano tomatoes to our fresh mozzarella di bufala, we never compromise on quality. We handle all setup and teardown, so you can focus on enjoying your event while we take care of delivering an unforgettable pizza experience.
